# Object Tracking with SAM2

## Leveraging SAM2 for Multi-Purpose Long Video Object Tracking

This repository provides a user-friendly interface for using [Meta AI's SAM2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) model to track objects in videos. It was developed as part of the EnvisionBOXBABY project, with a focus on analyzing infant-adult interactions using videos recorded from an infant's head-mounted camera.
